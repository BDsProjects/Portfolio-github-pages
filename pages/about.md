# **About Me**

Hi I am Billy Dolan :wave:,<br>
I am currently studing mechanical and aerospace engineering and I am in my final semester. After this semester I intend to pursue a Masters of Science in Aeropspace Engineering or a Masters of Physics in Space Science and Technology. The reposotories on my profile are related to my classes, continued learning in code, or some fun creations.
